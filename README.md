## Peanuts Pictures

Source images for the TidByt app I built for a friend

The pictures here can be used with https://www.pixilart.com/ to quickly get going if you want
to modify any of the ones I've already created.

Then to convert the images to base64 for use in the starlark script you can just do:

```bash
./img2base64.js images/path/to/image
```

Someday it'd be rad if I could autogen the whole starlark script, which shouldn't be to hard given
how simple it is overall.
